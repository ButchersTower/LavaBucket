Get a better understanding of the normal of of a plane.

How to give planes a directional orientation? Using l seems to do that with + and -

Lighting is weird in that opposing faces are matching in that dark and light.

like it isn't basing lighting off of the sides position right before it draws
	but either a preconceived face or its taking the normal of some faces in
	the wrong direction. 

It is lighting the right intead of the left. I need to see how the  premade
	program projects the points, i might be doing it like backwards.

Organize the programs i am currently working on into pocketDrag.
